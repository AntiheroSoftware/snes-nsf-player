(c)2001-2003 Joey Parsell (Memblers)
   w/ assistance from Kevin Horton, and others


Source code release.  Dec 27th, 2003.

 Contents:
	main.asm - the main program, made for the x816 assembler
	spc.asm  - SPC-700 program, made for TASM assembler (requires TASM700.TAB file)
	everything else - included data (waveforms, frequency tables)

This distribution is incomplete - it cannot be assembled as-is.  However, all the
needed code and data to play NSFs on SNES is included.  It's up to you to decide 
how to put this to use.  Email me if you need help or have any questions.

This code may not be used in commercial projects without written permission from the
author.  Other than that, do whatever with it.  If any of this code is used, a credit (in
the docs or program) is requested, but not required.


peace.
